            <p>
                Iâ€™m a human geographer and social researcher dedicated to advancing understanding of the complex issues
                that shape the politics and economy of British society. My work spans a range of themes, from elections and housing to
                inequality and energy efficiency, with a focus on spatial analysis and quantitative methodologies. 

                Driven by a commitment to creating a more equal society for all, my projects aim to provide
                valuable insights for a diverse audience of researchers, policymakers, and public stakeholders.

                Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in advanced quantitative techniques, GIS, econometrics, R,
                Excel, and policy analysis, complemented by strong skills in teaching and communication. You can see some of my work under the <strong>Projects</strong> section of this site.
