                Iâ€™m a human geographer and social researcher seeking to understand the complex issues that shape the politics and economy of Britain. I aim to provide insights for a diverse audience of researchers, policymakers, public stakeholders, and students.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work spans a range of themes, from elections and housing to inequality and energy efficiency, with a focus on spatial analysis and quantitative methodologies.

            <p>
                In 2024, I submitted my PhD in Human Geography at the <a href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/tom-cantellowUniversity of Bristol" target="_blank">University of Bristol</a>, and I've also worked with local and national government and think tanks. Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in advanced quantitative techniques, GIS, econometrics, policy analysis, and teaching and communication. You can see some of my work under the <a href="projects.html" target="_blank"><strong>Projects</strong></a> section of this site.
